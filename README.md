# Vendit-Shopping-App
Shopping mobile application using Android Java

## Project Info
This is a shopping application built in Android Java. This application allows users to browse through an inventory of drones and purchase any drones the user has selected to add to their cart, given that the selected drone is available in the inventory. When a user is satisfied, they can proceed to their cart where they can update the content of the cart by increasing the quantity of an item or decreasing the quantity. The user can then click on "Checkout" to proceed to checkout. In the checkout menu, the user then fills out their personal information and completes the order.

If the user is a seller, they have the option to add to the current inventory. On the main shopping page is a button where the seller can click and then input information for a new item they wish to add to the inventory.
